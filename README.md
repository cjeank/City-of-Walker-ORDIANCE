PREFACE 

This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Walker, Michigan. 

Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through August 27, 1991, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 

The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 

Chapter and Section Numbering System 

The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 

Page Numbering System 

The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix.

Index 

The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 

Looseleaf Supplements 

A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 

Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 

Acknowledgments 

This publication was under the direct supervision of Linda Davis, Senior Editor, and Charles Vignos, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 

The publisher is most grateful to Linda Wiser, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Adopting Ordinance
Ordinance No. 93-422 

An Ordinance to Adopt a Recodified Code of Ordinances for the City of Walker, Michigan. 

The City of Walker Ordains: 

Section 1. Repeal of existing "Code of Ordinances" and Adoption of Recodified "Code of Ordinances." Pursuant to the authority granted under Section 5b of Act 279 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1909, as amended, "Code of Ordinances, City of Walker, Michigan," as adopted April 13, 1976, as amended, consisting of Chapters 1 through 21 and Appendices A and B (the "1976 Code"), is hereby repealed in its entirety, and recodified "Code of Ordinances, City of Walker, Michigan," consisting of Chapters 1 through 94 and Appendix A (the "Code"), is adopted. 

Section 2. Ordinances Repealed; Saving Clause and Exceptions to Repeal. On the effective date of this Ordinance, all general and permanent ordinances of the City enacted on or before December 22, 1992, and not included in the Code or not recognized and continued in force by reference in the Code, are repealed. However, nothing in this Ordinance or in the Code shall affect any offense or act committed or done, or any penalty or forfeiture incurred, or any contract or right establish or accruing, before the effective date of this Ordinance or the Code, and all prosecutions, suits, actions and proceedings commenced under the 1976 Code of Ordinances, as amended, are hereby declared to be preserved and saved in full force and effect. Further, this repeal shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that was repealed by any ordinance that is repealed by this Ordinance; nor shall this Ordinance or the Code be construed to repeal or otherwise affect the validity of any ordinance as provided in Section 1-5 of the Code. 

Section 3. Additions and Amendments to Code. All additions or amendments to the Code, when passed in a form so as to indicate the intention of the City Commission to make the additions or amendments a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the "Code of Ordinances, City of Walker, Michigan," shall be construed to include the additions and amendments. Ordinances adopted after December 22, 1992, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 

Section 4. Penalties for Violations; Other Remedies. Unless a different fine or penalty is expressly provided, a violation of any provision of the Code, or any provision of any rule or regulation adopted or issued pursuant to the Code, shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and costs of prosecution, or by imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or by both fine and imprisonment, as provided in Section 1-11 of the Code. Unless a different fine or penalty is expressly provided, the penalty provided by this Section of this Ordinance and by Section 1-11 of the Code shall apply to any addition or amendment to the Code whether or not the penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition, the City may pursue all other available remedies for violations, including, without limitations, abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief, and revocation of licenses and permits. 

Section 5. Code Maintenance; Availability. A copy of the Code shall be kept on file in the office of the City Clerk for inspection by any public. It shall be the duty of the City Clerk, or the person designated by the City Clerk, to maintain this copy of the Code and to keep it up-to-date by inserting in the appropriate places of the Code all additions and amendments to the Code (as provided by Section 3 of this Ordinance) when the additions or amendments have been printed in page form, and by removing from the Code all provisions which may be from time to time repealed or otherwise effectively amended or revised by the City Commission. 

Section 6. Unlawful to Alter or Tamper with Code. It is unlawful for any person to alter or tamper with the Code in any manner for the purpose of causing a law of the City of Walker to be misrepresented. Any person violating this Section shall be punished as provided in Section 4 of this Ordinance. 

Section 7. Severability. The various parts, sections and clauses of this Ordinance are hereby declared to be severable. If any part, sentence, paragraph, section or clause is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the Ordinance shall not be affected thereby. 

Section 8. Effective Date. This Ordinance shall become effective immediately upon publication in a newspaper in general circulation within the City of Walker.
